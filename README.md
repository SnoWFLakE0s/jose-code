# Josecode 
by First Joshua Eah and Matviy Zhachek 
for CS 102 Section C Fall 2021

## Introduction
A simple extension of the C language for doing basic tasks. Funny function names and operators based on quotes from our MA111 professor. Completely impractical.  
Files are saved to `.josecode files.` Code should be individual line-by-line statements, and the compiler will go through one line at a time. The only data type in this language are floating-point numbers. This simplifies calculations a little.

## Technical Description

Describe your project's source code in terms of algorithms and data structures.
