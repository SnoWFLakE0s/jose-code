# jose-code
A simple extension of the C language for doing basic tasks. Funny function names and operators based on quotes from our MA111 professor. Completely impractical. By Joshua Eah and Matviy Zhachek for CS-102 Section C Fall 2021.

# Language Structure
Files are saved to `.josecode` files. Code should be individual line-by-line statements, and the compiler will go through one line at a time.
The only data type in this language are floating-point numbers. This simplifies calculations a little.

# Features
* Functions:
  *  Logarithm: `loggers ( x,a )`
     *  Logarithm of `x` with base `a`.
  *  Exponential: `power ( x,a )`
     *  `a` to the power of `x`.
  *  Round: `dontCareAboutValue()`
     *  Rounds the input number to the nearest value.
  *  Maxiumum: `bigger ( a,b )`
     *  Returns the larger number, `a` or `b`.
  *  Minimum: `smaller ( a,b )`
     *  Returns the smaller number, `a` or `b`.
  *  Random: `jazzup ( a,b )`
     *  Returns a random number between `a` and `b`.
* Math Operators:
  *  Addition Operator: `a PLUS b`
     *  Returns `a` plus `b`.
  *  Subtraction Operator: `a MINUS b`
     *  Returns `a` minus `b`.
  *  Multiplication Operator: `a TIMES b`
     *  Returns `a` times `b`.
  *  Division Operator: `\frac{a}{b}`
     *  Reuturns `a` divided by `b`.
* Logical Operators:
  * `EQUALTO`: Checks if two numbers are equal. Syntax: `a EQUALTO b`.
  * `NOT`: Checks if both numbers are not equal. Syntax: `a NOT b`
  * `OR`: Checks if either of two numbers are larger than 0. Syntax: `a OR b`.
  * `AND`: Checks if any of two numbers are larger than 0. Syntax: `a AND b`.
* Some Reserved Words:
  * `IFF{}{}`: If statements. If statement in first bracket is true, then execute the statement in 2nd bracket. 
  * `IS`: Variable assignment. Syntax: `a IS 5`
  * `RK:` Comments. The compiler will ignore this line for execution.

# Writing josecode
To begin writing josecode, simply create a plain text file with the file extension .josecode. Declare some variables like you would with any other C program:
```
int x;
```
You can now use them with other josecode functions, like in the program below, which returns the larger of the two numbers. Functions must be used inside the `tellme` function to get any output to the console. It is best practice to declare a `result` variable for your computation and for feeding into the `tellme` function. Proper function syntax is to put single spaces around the parentheses.
```
int x = 1;
int y = 2;
int result = bigger ( x,y );
tellme ( "The larger of x and y is %d\n", result );
```
Try running the example program above. To run a josecode program, make and run the josecode compiler. Running the compiler will prompt you for the josecode file. By this point, you should have placed your .josecode file inside `/input/`. Now, just type `name_of_file.josecode` when asked for the file, and the josecode compiler will build and run your new program. Congrats! You've just ran a josecode program.

Result:
```
>> The larger of x and y is 2
```
Here's the more advanced version of this program, which prompts for user input via the `giveme` function. 
```
int x;
int y;
tellme ( "Input your first number: " );
giveme ( "&d", &x );
tellme ( "Input your second number: " );
giveme ( "&d", &y );
int result = bigger ( x,y );
tellme ( "The larger of x and y is %d\n", result );
```
Welcome to josecode!
